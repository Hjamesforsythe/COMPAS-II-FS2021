<!-- You are about to submit an assignment! -->
<!-- For a title, it's enough to say indicate the assignment number, eg, `Assignment 01` -->

### Checklist

- [ ] Make sure the `name_lastname` folder is still there (ie. it was copied instead of renamed)
- [ ] Paste a screenshot of the solution whenever possible (`ctrl+v` or `cmd+v` directly on this textbox works)
- [ ] Add optional notes/remarks to be taken into account for evaluating the submission
